Nipper Firewall IP Extrator

This script, i made for my firewall audit as i got 55 firewalls and i have to make report on basis of vulnerabilities that is very annoying.
Copy from nipper HTML and paste it to report.So i write this script which make file with vulnerability name and insert IP addresses in that file.
which help in making report.

NOTE: File Naming is like this : 172_16_102_1_txt.html

If your file naming is different make changes in the script.
