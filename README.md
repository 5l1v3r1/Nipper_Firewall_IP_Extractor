Nipper CISCO ASA Firewall IP Extrator

we are working on a project in which we have to perform the configuration review of 55 firewalls and nipper generated 55 html reports. To prepare a report using those 55 html report will be super time consuming so ease out that process i have created this . it will simply merge all the reports and will generate a new csv sheet which will contain the list of vulnerabilities and the corresponding ip addresses on which these vulnerabilities exist.

NOTE: File Naming is like this : 172_16_102_1_txt.html

If your file naming is different make changes in the script.
